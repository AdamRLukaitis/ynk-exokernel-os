1) x  should be a uintptr_t type .



2) 


ENTRY							BASE VIRTUAL ADDRESS								POINTS TO 

1023							0xffbfffff										    Points to the top 4 MB of physical memory
1022							0xfbbfffff											Points to the second last 4 MB of physical memory
1021							0xf7bfffff										    Points to the third last 4 MB of physical memory
Continues in multiples of 4 MB


3)The pages are protrected with protection bits . Each page has a protection level associated with it . The protection level may be supervisor or user . When executing in the user mode only user level pages are accessible while kernel level pages cannot be accessed .

4)	The maximum memory that this operating system can support is 4GB because it uses 32 bit addressing scheme. (2^32 = 4GB)


5) Managing memory overhead items
 
 		a) Page Directory
 		b) Page Table
 		c) Guard Page
 		d) Mapping of physical memory to virtual memory occours at multiples of 4 bytes , so there is usually a small Roundup value which is not used.

6) The transition to an EIP  running above KERNBASE mark happens at the jump to the relocated function .  After the paging has been enabled by setting the flag in the CR0 register , the jump to the relocated function still runs in low address space , so as to take care of this condition the physical memory from 0-4MB is mapped to 0-4MB in virtual memory . 
This transition is necessary because the kernel is linked at an high memory address above the 1MB mark.
