1) The purpose of having an induvidial exception or interrupt is to prevent the user program from influencing what interrupt or exception is being raised.
If all the interrupts were delivered to the same handler then we could not handle different types of interrupts or exceptions

2)I did not have to change anything for user/softint program to run properly. Softint's code cannot cause interrupt $14 which is a page fault .This can only be invoked at ring 0 or when CPL = 0 . But softint runs in the user mode and cannot be running CPL = 0 therefore it raises a general protection fault which the grading script makes use of.

3)In the Setgate function for breakpoint function i set the prevliege level to 3 , so that it can be executed by user level code. 
If i had set it to 0 user level code cannot use breakpoints. (Otherwise it would raise a general protection fault)


4) This mechanism allows the user level code to set breakpoints without interfering with the kernel memory.
