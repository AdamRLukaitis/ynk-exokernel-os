1) I implemented the transmit structure , by first initalizing the TDH and TDT registers, i also initialized the EN,PSP,CT,COLD bits in TCTL registers and set the TDBAL register to the physical address of the transmit descriptors, TDLEN is the length of the transmit descriptors.
If the transmit descriptor is full then i do sched yeild of the CPU and repeat as long as the transmit descriptor is full.

2) I implemented the recieve structure by initalizing the RA registers,MTAregisters and the RCTL registers , i also set the RDLEN and RDH and RDT registers to the appropriate recieve descriptors length address head and tail respectivley.
If the recieve descriptor is empty then i add more descriptors from the software side.

3)The web page served by JOS's web server says "Cheesy Web Page"

4) It took me around 40 hours.
